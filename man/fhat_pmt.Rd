\title{Generate Multitaper Estimator of Power Spectrum for Functional Data}
\usage{
fhat_pmt(X, N, K, Rsel, stdz)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A T X R matrix of the functional data, where T is the length of the time series, and R is the number of components.}

\item{N}{The number of observations that will be contained in each roughly stationary block. N must satisfy: 30 <= N <= T}

\item{K}{The number of tapers to utilize in estimating the local power spectrum. K must satisfy: 1 <= K < floor(N/4 - 1)}

\item{Rsel}{The number of points within the functional domain that will be used for computing test statistics. Rsel must satisfy: 1 <= Rsel <= R}

\item{stdz}{A binary indicator to show whether the variance in each stationary block should be standardized.}
}
\value{
A 3-Dimensional matrix containing the multitaper estimator. Its dimensions are A x B x C, where A = floor(N/2 + 1), B = Rsel^2, and C = floor(T / N)
}
\description{
This function takes in the aforementioned functional data, as well as a few other parameters, and returns the multitaper
estimate of the power spectrum for the data. This works in a piecewise manner, hence why it has the suffix _pmt, for piecewise
multitaper
}
\details{
Every input must be either a Boolean or Numeric, as mentioned above \cr \cr
